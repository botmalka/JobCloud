# JobCloud

I got the idea for this project after I was told to look at a number of job postings for positions I'd like and see what libraries and technologies they're looking for

This code pulls data science jobs and accounting jobs from Indeed.com, finds the words that are in DS jobs, but not accounting postings. 
Then it makes a dictionary with the frequency of each word and makes a word cloud from that
